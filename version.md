## Current Release

1. An initial **directional colors** system has been implemented with fine-tuning adjustments.  

>   *I fully understand that the rules for shapes are vague — the idea is that you can adjust them as you see fit, in whatever way works best for your game. This was very >   challenging and ran into my current execution limits. It’s something I’ll be able to achieve in the future, but first I need to refactor parts of the code. Please be >   patient with this and keep sending ideas.*
>
>  *For now, directional colors only work on flat-tops — and it was a huge mistake on my part to forget about pointy-top! I promise I’ll fix this.*

2. It is now possible to display either **directional colors** or just the **outline**.  
3. **Zoom tools** have been added to assist users with visual or motor difficulties in clicking on hexes. These can be adjusted in the settings.  
4. A **redesign** to reduce the number of clicks and improve overall organization.  
5. **Right-clicking** on a preset gives the user an icon on their token, allowing them to **assemble/disassemble** it themselves!

## Next Release

1. Remove `ui.info` calls.  
2. Sanitize the console logs.  
3. Prepare the code for **pointy-top** grids.  
4. Allow characters to use **multiple mounts** via macro or token button.  
5. Move the release fully **inside the module**.  
6. Provide better **documentation on GitHub** explaining what the module does.  
Quer que eu faça também uma versão em changelog mais formal (estilo patch notes de software), ou mantém esse formato direto mesmo?
