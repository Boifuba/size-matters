Benefits of These Changes

    Better Performance: Debounced operations prevent excessive saves and redraws
    Cleaner Architecture: Clear separation of responsibilities between modules
    Reduced Redundancy: Eliminated duplicate code and conflicting configurations
    Improved Maintainability: Centralized hook management and consistent patterns
    Better User Experience: More responsive UI with optimized update cycles


    Consistency: Both the preview in SizeMattersApp and the canvas rendering now use the same data structure
    Performance: Eliminates string manipulation and DOM parsing for SVG generation
    Maintainability: Centralized geometry calculations in GridManager
    Extensibility: The structured data format makes it easier to add new visual effects or rendering modes
    PIXI.js Alignment: Better integration with Foundry VTT's rendering architecture
