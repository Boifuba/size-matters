### Preset Management

#### Saving Presets
1. Configure your desired settings (grid selection, colors, thickness, opacity, image, rotation, etc.)
2. Enter a name in the "Enter preset name..." field
3. Click the **Save** button (üíæ icon) to save the current configuration
4. The preset will be available in the dropdown for future use

#### Loading Presets
1. Select a preset from the dropdown menu
2. Click the **Load** button (üìÅ icon) to apply the preset settings

4. Changes are applied immediately with visual feedback

#### Deleting Presets
1. Select the preset you want to delete from the dropdown
2. Click the **Delete** button (üóëÔ∏è icon)
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog that appears
4. The preset will be permanently removed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Select a token first"**
- Make sure you have a token selected before running the macro or chat command
- Ensure you have permission to control the selected token

**"This module works with hexagonal and square grids only!"**
- Your scene must use a supported grid type
- Check your scene configuration under Grid settings
- Supported: Hex grids (all variants) and Square grids

**Image not loading**
- Verify the image path is correct and accessible to FoundryVTT
- Ensure the image file exists and hasn't been moved
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, WEBP, SVG
- Check browser console for specific error messages

**Highlights not following token**
- Try clearing and redrawing the highlight
- Make sure the token hasn't been deleted or replaced
- Check that the scene grid is properly configured

**Chat command not working**
- Ensure the module is enabled and loaded
- Try refreshing the page if the module was recently enabled
- Check browser console for error messages

**Presets not saving**
- Ensure you have GM permissions (presets are world-level settings)
- Check that the preset name doesn't contain special characters
- Try refreshing and attempting again

**Image rotation not working**
- Ensure the image is properly loaded first
- Check that the rotation slider is being moved
- Image rotation combines with token rotation

### Performance Tips
- Use appropriately sized images for better performance
- Clear highlights when not needed to free up resources
- The module automatically optimizes rendering for your grid type
- Limit the number of tokens with active highlights in complex scenes

### Debug Information
If you encounter issues:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for "Size Matters:" prefixed messages
3. Include relevant console output when reporting issues
